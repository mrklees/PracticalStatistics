# Practical Statistics
Welcome! This content was developed by Alex Perusse as part of a professional development series on practical statistics for the staff of City Year. In the style of [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) and some others, this couse priorities conceptual understanding and then practical applicability over the mathematics and theory of the subject. The data used was generally related to what would be observed on the job by analysts around the network as to be applicable as possible.

Unfortuantely for right now I cannot accept pull requests because the files were actually developed in Colab and rely on some of the interactivity supported there, but please open an issue if there are any errors you would like corrected or if you generally have any questions.

The content of the notebooks are open source.  Please feel free to use them for your own professional development and share them with others.
